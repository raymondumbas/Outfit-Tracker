# FitCheck
An app used to keep track of clothes with the primary purpose of creating outfits out of those pieces.

### Current Functionality
Nothing: more to come

### Motive
Just a personal project from someone who wants more experience in developing an app from planning to designing to coding. Fashion and computer science are two of my hobbies so this project is an intersection of that, which makes me excited to work on it.

### Workflow
Pull Requests
- I'm the only one working on this app
- PR's are only for linking commits to issues

Issues
- Labels for type and page
- Used for everything
- If I push without a PR, commit hash will be commented on issue

Documentation
- Small and medium sized decisions are in main ADR.md
- Decisions with a lot of reasoning will be in a separate ADR
